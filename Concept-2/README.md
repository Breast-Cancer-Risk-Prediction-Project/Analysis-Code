# Concept 2

Title: Validating existing breast cancer risk prediction models for the general population using self-reported or clinical data across diverse prospective cohorts

 Aims

1.	Derive estimated five- and ten-year absolute risks in participating BCRPP cohorts based on the existing risk models, including: Gail/BCRAT (including Asian American Breast Cancer Study model (AABCS) and African American model (CARE)); BOADICEA (excluding pathogenic variants and breast density), iCARE-Lit; Simplified Rosner-Colditz (2020); Tyrer-Cusick/IBIS (excluding pathogenic variants and mammographic density); and the BWHS Breast Cancer Risk Calculator. 

2.	Estimate calibration and risk discrimination within each cohort included in the BCRPP, stratified by race (White, Black, Asian populations and ethnicity (Hispanic/Non-Hispanic populations), self-identified or inferred based on country of origin. Additional analyses will stratify by age and menopausal status.
